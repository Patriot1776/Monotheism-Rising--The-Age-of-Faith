EVTNAMEPA.10031;Formation of the Imperial Church;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPA.10031;With the restoration of the Roman Empire and spread of the Orthodox faith, [From.GetTitledName] has decided to reform the church to a centralised model. The Patriarch of Constantinople has moved to Rome and the Pentarchs have been demoted to ordinary bishops. The Imperial Church has assumed control over all places of worship in the Roman Empire and demanded that all Christians convert to the new faith.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPA.10033;St Peter's Knights;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPA.10033;Even though it may enjoy Rome's support, the Imperial Church's position is tenuous at best, with many within the Empire still following the words of heretics and infidels. In an effort to secure it's position and spread the true faith, the bishops of the Imperial Church have sanctioned the creation of a holy order, the Knights of Saint Peter. Church bells ring out as the knights march to their garrisons, ready to defend their faith from infidels and heretics alike.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPA.10034;Imperial Crusades;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPA.10034;With the Roman Empire under threat from heretics and infidels alike, the bishops of the Imperial Church have accepted the possibility that an outright invasion of foreign lands may be necessary. The Orthodox religion was never big on the concept of holy war, regarding the Catholic Crusaders as barbarians, especially after the Fourth Crusade, but times are changing, and Rome is no longer Orthodox. A new era of Christian expansion has begun, with the Roman Empire at the forefront.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEPA.10082;Reconquest of Dacia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPA.10082;The former Roman province of Dacia has been brought back under Imperial control. The heavily forested kingdom was conquered by Emperor Trajan in 106 AD, who turned it into a Roman colony. Abandoned in 271 by Emperor Aurelian, the area became the home of various tribal peoples, such as the Gepids, Huns, and Avars, who frequently undertook raids across the Danube. With the reconquest of this fertile basin, Rome's Balkan provinces are now secure.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPA.10083;Conquest of Persia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPA.10083;After centuries of warfare, Persia has finally been brought under Imperial control. The Persians were long-time rivals of Rome, and nearly caused it's downfall after the Roman-Sassanid wars of the 7th century. The Persian lands which were taken by Emperor Trajan were abandoned under his successor, Hardian, who seen them as indefensible, allowing the Parthians to recover them. With the conquest of Persia, Rome's rich eastern lands are now secure.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPA.10103;A team of construction workers accidentally tunnelled into the ruins of an ancient pagan temple during the renovation of Rome's sewer system. The cavern they came across is filled with ancient pagan idols and contains a library full of preserved tomes. A large eagle adorns the top of the cavern, and a statue of a wolf stands near the caverns original entrance, now bricked up.

EVTDESCPA.10174;You order your guards to drop their weapons so the man may approach. They hesitate at first, but place them on the ground after you throw away your own dagger.
