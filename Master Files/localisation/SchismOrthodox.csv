Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has called the Pentarchy for a review the Council of Chalcedon who in turned sent [Root.GetTitledFirstName] a letter to reconsider their Church's stance on the issue.\n\nThe conditions for communion has been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
