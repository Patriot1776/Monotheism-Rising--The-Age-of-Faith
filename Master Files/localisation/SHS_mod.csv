EVTDESCSHS.101;Despite confessing what is essentially the same faith, the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church has been at odds with each other since the Seven Ecumenical Councils.

EVTNAMESHS.103;Review of the Council of Chalcedon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.103;The Council of Chalcedon, or the Fourth Ecumenical Council, saw the split between those who spoke either Greek or Latin and those who did not speak those languages. The former became known as the "Melkites" while the latter were accused of "Monophysitism". Despite several subsequent councils to reconcile the two, they all ended up with new heresies. Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] called for a review the Council of Chalcedon, asking [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to reconsider their Church's stance on the issue.\n\nThe conditions for communion has been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHS.105;The Council of Ephesus, or the Third Ecumenical Council, saw the split between the Church in Rome and the Church in Persia. Though it was used as a political tool by then Sassanid King, the latter were accused of "Adoptionism" as well as the advent of Islam.

Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] called for a review the Council of Ephesus, asking [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to reconsider their Church's stance on the issue.\n\nThe conditions for communion has been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHS.108;As you and your fellow Crusaders travel towards the Holy Land, you come across some Semitic people near Mount Lebanon. Upon further investigation, you learn that these people are Maronites, a community established by Saint Maron, thought to have been long extinct since the Monothelite controversy.\n\nThough they claim to have always been loyal to Rome, it has been centuries since they have had communication with the rest of Christendom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMESHS.111;The New Patriarchate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.111;With communications re-established between the Maronites and the rest of Christendom thanks to the Crusaders, the Maronites have re-affirmed their affiliation with Church of Rome. To commemorate the occasion, [From.RelHead.GetBestName] sent their leader, [Root.GetFirstName] a crown and a staff, elevating [Root.GetHerHim] to that of a Patriarch of Antioch in Boutron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSHS.111;God bless the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTESHS.111;They're still just mountain people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESHS.112;Order of Saint Maron;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.112;With the re-discovery of the Maronites which the Church of Rome was previously unaware of, the Crusaders had all the Maronites they have encountered detained under the suspicion of heresy. Having persecuted by the Byzantines and the Druze before, those who were able escape the Crusaders grasp were outraged at how they were treated\n\nWith no one else to turn to, the remnants of the Maronites have decided to fend for themselves by militarising their community and taking up arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSHS.112;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSHS.112;We shall fend for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDSHS.112;Violence are the way of heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTESHS.112;Oh dear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESHS.113;Maronite Catholics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.113;Now that communion had been re-affirmed between the Maronites and the See of Rome, the relationship further deepend with the confirmation of the Maronite Patriarchate, the Maronites flocked towards the banner of the Crusaders in retaking the Holy Lands in the name of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHS.114;The inquisition against the Maronites finally coming to a close, [Root.RelHead.GetBestName] has re-affirmed the Third Council of Constantinople and declared an anathema to all the Maronites as Monothelite heretics.\n\nUntil they fully repent and return in penance to the Church of Rome, the Pope has declared that all properties of the Maronites are forfeit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDSHS.114;They shall be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMESHS.117;The Western Schism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.117;The Antipope phenomenom, an opponent of a sitting Pope, was not a new thing, having existed since the early third century whether elevated by rival factions or secular rulers. However, the ascension of [From.GetFirstName] marks the first time an Antipope was chosen by the very same people who elected the sitting Pope, [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nAn era of corruption of clergy in Catholic Europe, secular princes prepare to take sides as uncertainties of their Church looms ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASHS.117;Anathema to the pretender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSHS.117;I am the true successor of Saint Peter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMESHS.118;An Olive Branch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.118;With the existence of two claimaints to the See of Rome threatening to tear apart Europe in two, the College of Cardinal has reached a decision to solve this issue by asking both the Pope and the Antipope to resign thus leaving the office vacant so another may be elected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHS.120;Despite the impending crisis or perhaps because of it, the two sides have decided to resolve the matter peacefully, resigning their claim to the See of Rome allowing the College of Cardinal to elect a new Pope in their places.\n\nWith that, the crisis in Catholic Europe has been averted though whether this is the last time such an event occurs remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASHS.120;For the love of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMESHS.121;Three Popes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHS.121;Although the Cardinals begged the two sitting incumbent to resign for the peace of their Church, the two claimaints have steadfastly refused to step down.\n\nIn order to bring back order, the College of Cardinal decided to elect a third claimaint to the See of Rome so that the incumbents may decide to resign then, but instead has backfired resulting in an unprecedented event of having three living rival claimants to Throne of Saint Peter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSHS.121;Christ have mercy on us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSHS.121;Hah! The schismatics having more schisms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
