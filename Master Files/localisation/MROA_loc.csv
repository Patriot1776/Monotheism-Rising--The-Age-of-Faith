EVTTITLE_MROA_100;The [Root.Religion.GetName] Reformation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MROA_100;With the construction of the Third Temple and the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel complete, the time has come for a decision to reinstate the priesthood and the resumption of sacrifices at the temple. By reinstating the priesthood, you are choosing to reform [Root.Religion.GetName] into Temple Judaism. In Temple Judaism, the priesthood and Jerusalem as the center of religious focus are most important. All decisions are left to the Tribe of Levi and for you to execute their will. Followers may go on pilgrimages and set the interval for when sacrifices are performed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_MROA.101;The [Root.Religion.GetName] Reformation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MROA.101;The Grand Sanhedrin are a religious movement that emerged out of Rabbinic Judaism after the restoration of the Third Temple, taking inspiration from the historical Pharisees that were popular prior to the destruction of the second temple, and who some see as the forerunners of the Rabbinic tradition. Whilst the Grand Sanhedrin accept the reinstitution of the Temple and Priesthood, as well as the rituals and ceremonies that come with it, they have a number of objections to the power and authority that is being concentrated in the hands of the Levites, instead arguing that interpretation and judicial authority should rest in the Sanhedrins (religious courts) rather than the priesthood. In addition they also support the authority of the Oral Torah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
